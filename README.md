# CDD-NaiveBayes
Repository with my Naive Bayes Classificator, which was created for my Data Science class. Insper 2018.2

Did it with the help of Andr√© Dambry (@adambry) and Luigi Portugal (@LuigiPortugal).

There's a copy of this classificator (with our full project) and an evaluation of it at https://github.com/LuigiPortugal/CDD---Projeto-2.
